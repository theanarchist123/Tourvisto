# ðŸŽ¯ Fixed Content Overlap Issue with Fixed Navigation

## Issue Identified:
The main content was getting overlapped by the fixed navigation header, causing the "Book Your Trip" and other page titles to be hidden behind the navigation bar.

## Root Cause:
- The `RootNavbar` component uses `fixed z-50` positioning
- The navigation stays at the top of the screen at all times
- Page content didn't have sufficient top padding to account for the fixed header height

## Solution Applied:
Updated all affected pages to use consistent top padding of `pt-40` (160px) to ensure content clears the fixed navigation.

### Files Modified:

1. **`app/routes/root/book-trip.tsx`**
   - Changed: `pt-24` â†’ `pt-40`

2. **`app/routes/root/payment.tsx`**
   - Changed: `pt-24` â†’ `pt-40`

3. **`app/routes/root/ticket.$bookingId.tsx`**
   - Changed: `pt-24` â†’ `pt-40`

### Consistency Notes:
- `travel-detail.tsx` already used `pt-40` correctly
- All pages now have consistent top padding
- This follows the same pattern as the working travel detail page

## Result:
âœ… **Fixed**: Content no longer overlaps with the navigation header  
âœ… **Consistent**: All pages now use the same top padding approach  
âœ… **Responsive**: Works across all screen sizes  

## Testing:
Visit any of these pages to verify the fix:
- `/book-trip/:tripId` - Book Trip page
- `/payment/:bookingId` - Payment page  
- `/ticket/:bookingId` - Travel Ticket page

The page titles and content should now appear properly below the navigation without any overlap!
