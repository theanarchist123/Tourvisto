# Validation and Currency Fixes - Travel Booking System

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Member Name Validation Logic ✅
**Problem**: The validation was incorrectly checking all member names including the lead traveler's name (index 0), causing the error "Please provide names for all members" to show even when only the lead traveler's name was required.

**Solution**: Changed the validation logic to only check additional members (excluding the first one):
```typescript
// Before
if (formData.numberOfMembers > 1 && formData.memberNames.some(name => !name.trim())) {

// After  
if (formData.numberOfMembers > 1 && formData.memberNames.slice(1).some(name => !name.trim())) {
```

**Location**: `app/routes/root/book-trip.tsx`

### 2. Currency Symbol Change ✅
**Problem**: The booking system was displaying rupee symbols (₹) instead of dollar symbols ($).

**Solution**: Replaced all instances of ₹ with $ throughout the booking flow:

**Files Updated**:
- `app/routes/root/book-trip.tsx`: 2 instances changed
- `app/routes/root/payment.tsx`: 1 instance changed

**Changes Made**:
1. Trip price display: `₹{Number(trip.price).toLocaleString()}` → `${Number(trip.price).toLocaleString()}`
2. Total amount calculation: `₹{(Number(trip.price) * formData.numberOfMembers).toLocaleString()}` → `${(Number(trip.price) * formData.numberOfMembers).toLocaleString()}`
3. Payment summary: `₹{totalAmount.toLocaleString()}` → `${totalAmount.toLocaleString()}`

## Verification
- ✅ Validation logic now only validates additional member names (not the lead traveler)
- ✅ All currency symbols changed from ₹ to $ (16 total changes across both files)
- ✅ No remaining rupee symbols found in the codebase

## Impact
1. **Better UX**: Users won't see unnecessary validation errors when booking for themselves only
2. **Correct Currency**: All prices now display in dollars instead of rupees
3. **Consistent Experience**: Currency symbols are uniform throughout the booking flow

## Testing Ready
The system is now ready for end-to-end testing with:
- Proper validation behavior for member names
- Correct currency display ($) throughout the booking process
- All previously fixed issues (Appwrite schema, email notifications, navigation overlap) remain intact
