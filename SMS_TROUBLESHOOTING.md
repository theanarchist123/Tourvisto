# 🔧 SMS Not Working? Here's the Complete Fix!

## 🎯 **The Problem**
You have a **Twilio Trial Account** which can only send SMS to **verified phone numbers**. This is a security feature to prevent spam during the trial period.

## ✅ **Solution: Verify Your Phone Number**

### **Method 1: Automatic Verification (Recommended)**

1. **Run the verification script**:
   ```bash
   node verify-phone.mjs +919876543210
   ```
   *(Replace with your actual phone number)*

2. **Answer the verification call**:
   - You'll receive a phone call within 1-2 minutes
   - Answer it and follow the instructions
   - Press the key or enter the code as instructed

3. **Test SMS**:
   - Book a ticket in your app
   - You should now receive SMS!

### **Method 2: Manual Verification (Backup)**

1. **Go to Twilio Console**: https://console.twilio.com/
2. **Navigate to Phone Numbers**:
   - Click "Phone Numbers" in the left sidebar
   - Click "Manage"
   - Click "Verified Caller IDs"
3. **Add Your Number**:
   - Click the red "+" button
   - Enter your phone number: `+919876543210`
   - Choose "SMS" as verification method
4. **Verify**:
   - You'll receive an SMS with a code
   - Enter the code to verify
5. **Test**:
   - Book a ticket - SMS will now work!

## 🧪 **Test Your SMS Setup**

### **Step 1: Verify Your Number**
Use either method above to verify your phone number.

### **Step 2: Book a Test Ticket**
1. Go to your app: http://localhost:5173
2. Browse trips and book one
3. Use your verified phone number
4. Complete the payment flow
5. Check your phone for SMS confirmation!

### **Step 3: Check Console Logs**
If SMS still doesn't work, check the browser console and terminal for detailed error messages.

## 🔍 **Troubleshooting**

### **Issue: "Phone number not verified"**
**Solution**: Follow the verification steps above

### **Issue: "Invalid phone number format"**
**Solution**: Use E.164 format: `+919876543210` (include country code)

### **Issue: "Authentication failed"**
**Solution**: Check your Twilio credentials in `.env.local`

### **Issue: Still no SMS after verification**
**Solutions**:

3. Try a different phone number
4. Restart your development server
