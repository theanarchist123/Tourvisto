# 🚀 Payment Success Redirect Fix

## ✅ **Issue Fixed**

The problem was that the `payment-success` route was nested under the authenticated layout (`page-layout.tsx`), which was redirecting users to `/sign-in` when they returned from Stripe checkout because their session was lost during the redirect.

## 🔧 **Changes Made**

### 1. **Route Configuration Update**
- Moved `payment-success` route outside the authenticated layout
- Now it's a top-level route that doesn't require authentication

### 2. **Component Updates**
- Added Header component to payment-success page
- Maintained consistent styling with background and layout

### 3. **No Authentication Required**
- Payment success page now works without user authentication
- Uses `bookingId` and `session_id` from URL to confirm booking
- Perfect for post-Stripe redirect scenarios

## 📋 **Next Steps for Vercel Deployment**

### 1. **Push Changes to Git**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix payment success redirect issue"
git push origin main
```

### 2. **Verify Environment Variables in Vercel**
Make sure these are set in Vercel Dashboard → Project → Settings → Environment Variables:
- `VITE_BASE_URL=https://tourvisto-v6th.vercel.app`
- All other environment variables from your `.env.local`

### 3. **Test the Flow**
1. Deploy the changes
2. Go to your site and book a trip
3. Complete payment on Stripe
4. Should now redirect to payment-success page (not sign-in)

## 🎯 **How It Works Now**

```
User completes payment on Stripe
↓
Stripe redirects to: https://tourvisto-v6th.vercel.app/payment-success?bookingId=xxx&session_id=xxx
↓
payment-success.tsx loader runs (NO AUTH CHECK)
↓
confirmBookingAndSendEmail() confirms the booking
↓
User sees success page with confetti! 🎉
```

## 🔍 **Troubleshooting**

If you still get redirected to sign-in:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify the Stripe success URL is correct in your payment creation
3. Make sure environment variables are set in Vercel
4. Check if cookies are being blocked

## ✨ **Success!**

Your payment flow should now work perfectly on Vercel! Users will see the payment success page with confetti and booking confirmation after completing their payment. 🎉
